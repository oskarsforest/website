Real Madrid won the Clásico after a spectacular second half which saw them overturn Piqué's goal with a strike from Benzema and another from Cristiano Ronaldo when they were down to ten men after Sergio Ramos' sending off. The first half was intense but finished goalless. Barcelona had the first chance in the 10th minute but Luis Suárez failed to convert just in front of goal after a cross from Messi.

Both teams were reaching the opposition area and the hosts had another chance in the 19th minute when Rakitic took advantage of a loose ball to hit a shot with his left foot, but Keylor Navas was more than equal to it and he saved at full stretch. The minutes passed and halfway through the first period Cristiano Ronaldo responded. The Portuguese, at that time operating from the right wing, cut inside on the edge of the area and shot with his left foot in the 25th minute, but Bravo beat it away with his fists uncomfortably. That wasn't all though, as Benzema had the last opportunity of the half. His instinctive strike from the penalty spot in the 43rd minute failed to hit the target.
